SignatureAnalyzer.h Explanation
---------------------------------

Purpose:
- Declares the SignatureAnalyzer class, which detects known attacks based on blacklisted IP addresses and suspicious ports.

Classes and Structures:
- Class: SignatureAnalyzer
  - Inherits from Analyzer base class.

Important Data Members:
- AlertManager& alertManager:
  - Reference to AlertManager used to log alerts.
- FirewallManager& firewallManager:
  - Reference to FirewallManager used to block malicious IPs.
- GeoIPResolver geoResolver:
  - Used to determine the country of the detected IP.
- std::unordered_set<std::string> blacklistedIPs:
  - Contains a list of known malicious IP addresses.
- std::unordered_set<int> suspiciousPorts:
  - Contains a list of ports associated with risky services (e.g., Telnet, RDP).

Important Methods:
- SignatureAnalyzer(AlertManager& alertMgr, FirewallManager& fwMgr):
  - Constructor initializing references and loading signatures.
- void analyze(const Packet& packet) override:
  - Checks packet source IP and destination port against blacklists.
- std::string getName() const override:
  - Returns the name "Signature-Based Analyzer".

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Inheritance**:
  - SignatureAnalyzer inherits from Analyzer and implements its virtual methods.
- **Polymorphism**:
  - Overrides virtual methods (analyze and getName) for specific detection behavior.
- **Encapsulation**:
  - Internal details like blacklists and firewall calls are hidden behind simple public methods.

Connections to Other Modules:
- Receives Packet objects from IDS.cpp.
- If a packet matches a signature, it generates an Alert and calls FirewallManager to block the IP.
- Enhances alerts with country information using GeoIPResolver.
