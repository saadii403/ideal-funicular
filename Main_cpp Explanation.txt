Main.cpp Explanation
----------------------

Purpose:
- Implements the user interface (text-based menu) that allows the user to interact with the IDS system.

Functions and Logic:
- Displays a menu with options:
  1. List Network Interfaces
  2. Start Live Capture
  3. Analyze PCAP File
  4. View Alerts
  5. Clear Alerts
  6. Exit

- User selects an option, and the corresponding IDS function is called.

Important Parts:
- Lists available network devices using pcap_findalldevs().
- Allows the user to select a device for live capture.
- Prompts user for PCAP file name if analyzing offline.
- Calls IDS.showAlerts() to display recorded alerts.
- Calls IDS.clearAlerts() to reset alerts list.

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Encapsulation**:
  - The Main function interacts with IDS only through its public methods (startLiveCapture, loadPcapFile, etc.).
- **Abstraction**:
  - The user interface (main.cpp) hides all the low-level details like packet parsing, analyzer behavior, or firewall commands.

Connections to Other Modules:
- Creates an IDS object that internally:
  - Uses Packet, AlertManager, FirewallManager.
  - Uses analyzers (SignatureAnalyzer, AnomalyAnalyzer) to detect and block attacks.
- Receives user input and triggers appropriate IDS operations.
