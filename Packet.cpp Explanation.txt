Packet.cpp Explanation
------------------------

Purpose:
- Implements the methods defined in Packet.h for the Packet class.

Functions Implemented:
- Packet::Packet()
  - Constructor that initializes all fields of a Packet object with the captured data.

- Getter Methods:
  - getSourceIP(): Returns the source IP address.
  - getDestinationIP(): Returns the destination IP address.
  - getSourcePort(): Returns the source port number.
  - getDestinationPort(): Returns the destination port number.
  - getProtocol(): Returns the protocol used (TCP, UDP, OTHER).
  - getTimestamp(): Returns the time the packet was captured.
  - getLength(): Returns the packet length in bytes.

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Encapsulation**:
  - Data members are private.
  - Controlled access is provided through public getters.
- **Abstraction**:
  - Users interact with a clean interface (getter functions) without worrying about internal implementation.

Connections to Other Modules:
- IDS.cpp calls the Packet constructor to create a Packet object when parsing live/pcap packet data.
- Analyzers (SignatureAnalyzer and AnomalyAnalyzer) use the getters to inspect packet properties for threat detection.
