FirewallManager.h Explanation
-------------------------------

Purpose:
- Declares the FirewallManager class responsible for automatically blocking malicious IP addresses through the Windows Firewall.

Classes and Structures:
- Class: FirewallManager
  - Manages firewall rules to block traffic from detected attackers.

Important Data Members:
- std::set<std::string> blockedIPs:
  - Stores IP addresses that have already been blocked to avoid duplicate rules.

Important Methods:
- void blockIP(const std::string& ip):
  - Adds a Windows Firewall rule to block the given IP address in both inbound and outbound directions.
- bool isBlocked(const std::string& ip) const:
  - Checks if a given IP address is already in the blocked list.

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Encapsulation**:
  - The list of blocked IPs is private and only modified through public methods.
- **Abstraction**:
  - Users simply call `blockIP(ip)` without worrying about the exact Windows firewall commands.

Connections to Other Modules:
- Called by SignatureAnalyzer and AnomalyAnalyzer after detecting a suspicious packet.
- Ensures that once an attack is detected, the attacker's traffic is blocked in real time.
