GeoIPResolver.h Explanation
-----------------------------

Purpose:
- Declares the GeoIPResolver class responsible for mapping IP prefixes to country names for geographic threat intelligence.

Classes and Structures:
- Class: GeoIPResolver
  - Provides a lightweight mechanism to resolve attacker IP addresses into country names.

Important Data Members:
- std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> ipToCountry:
  - Stores mappings of IP address prefixes (like "192.168", "203.0") to country names.

Important Methods:
- GeoIPResolver():
  - Constructor that automatically loads the static IP-to-country mapping.

- std::string getCountry(const std::string& ip) const:
  - Given an IP address, returns the corresponding country name if found, or "Unknown" otherwise.

Private Methods:
- void loadStaticData():
  - Fills the ipToCountry map with some hardcoded values for fast lookup.

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Encapsulation**:
  - Internal map (ipToCountry) is private.
  - Only public access is through getCountry().

Connections to Other Modules:
- Used by SignatureAnalyzer and AnomalyAnalyzer to append country information to generated alerts.
- Helps create more informative and professional logs and reports.
