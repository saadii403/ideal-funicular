FirewallManager.cpp Explanation
---------------------------------

Purpose:
- Implements the methods declared in FirewallManager.h to dynamically block malicious IP addresses using the system's firewall.

Functions Implemented:
- blockIP(const std::string& ip):
  - Checks if the IP is already blocked.
  - Constructs a system command using Windows `netsh advfirewall firewall add rule` to block the IP both inbound and outbound.
  - Executes the command using std::system().
  - Records the blocked IP into the internal set.

- isBlocked(const std::string& ip) const:
  - Looks up the IP address in the internal blockedIPs set to determine if it has already been blocked.

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Encapsulation**:
  - Only FirewallManager class manages the list of blocked IPs and interacts with the firewall.
- **Abstraction**:
  - Users interact through simple functions; they do not need to understand or manually configure the Windows Firewall.

Connections to Other Modules:
- SignatureAnalyzer.cpp and AnomalyAnalyzer.cpp call blockIP() when suspicious activity is detected.
- IDS.cpp indirectly benefits because the FirewallManager ensures malicious IPs are blocked automatically after alert generation.
