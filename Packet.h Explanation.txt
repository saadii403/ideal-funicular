Packet.h Explanation
----------------------

Purpose:
- Defines the Packet class, which models a captured network packet with important metadata.

Classes and Structures:
- Class: Packet
  - Represents a network packet, including source and destination information.

Important Data Members:
- std::string sourceIP: Stores the IP address of the packet sender.
- std::string destinationIP: Stores the IP address of the packet receiver.
- int sourcePort: Source TCP/UDP port.
- int destinationPort: Destination TCP/UDP port.
- std::string protocol: Protocol used (TCP, UDP, OTHER).
- std::chrono::system_clock::time_point timestamp: Time the packet was captured.
- int length: Size of the captured packet in bytes.

Important Methods:
- Constructor: Initializes all data members when a new Packet is created.
- Getter methods: Provide access to private data (getSourceIP(), getDestinationIP(), etc.).

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Encapsulation**: 
  - All data members are private.
  - Only accessible through public getter methods, protecting data integrity.
- **Abstraction**:
  - Users of Packet class only need to know about getters, not internal storage details.

Connections to Other Modules:
- IDS.cpp creates Packet objects after parsing network data.
- Packet objects are passed to analyzers (SignatureAnalyzer, AnomalyAnalyzer) for threat detection.
