Alert.h Explanation
---------------------

Purpose:
- Defines the Alert class that encapsulates the information about a detected security event.

Classes and Structures:
- Class: Alert
  - Represents a security alert with details like type, description, and timestamp.

Important Data Members:
- std::string type: 
  - The kind of alert (e.g., "Signature Match", "Anomaly Detected").
- std::string description:
  - Detailed information about the reason for the alert (e.g., "Blacklisted IP detected: 203.0.113.77").
- std::chrono::system_clock::time_point timestamp:
  - The exact time the alert was generated.

Important Methods:
- Constructor: 
  - Initializes an Alert object with type, description, and timestamp.
- Getter methods:
  - getType(): Returns the type of the alert.
  - getDescription(): Returns the description.
  - getTimestamp(): Returns the timestamp.

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Encapsulation**:
  - All data members are private.
  - Public getters provide controlled access to alert information.
- **Abstraction**:
  - The details of how an Alert is stored are hidden; users only interact with the public interface.

Connections to Other Modules:
- SignatureAnalyzer and AnomalyAnalyzer create Alert objects when threats are detected.
- AlertManager uses these Alert objects to log, display, and manage the alerts.
