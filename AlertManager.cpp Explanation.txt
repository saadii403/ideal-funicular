AlertManager.cpp Explanation
------------------------------

Purpose:
- Implements the methods declared in AlertManager.h to manage and record security alerts.

Functions Implemented:
- logAlert(const Alert& alert):
  - Locks the alertMutex to ensure thread safety.
  - Adds the alert to the internal vector.
  - Appends the alert details to the alerts.log file on disk.

- showAlerts() const:
  - Locks the alertMutex to read safely.
  - Displays all alerts currently stored in the internal list to the console in a readable format.

- clearAlerts():
  - Locks the alertMutex.
  - Clears the alerts vector, removing all stored alerts.

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Encapsulation**:
  - Internal storage (vector of alerts) and synchronization (mutex) are private.
- **Abstraction**:
  - Exposes simple methods for users to log, show, or clear alerts without worrying about file IO or threading details.
- **Thread Safety**:
  - Implements locking (`std::lock_guard<std::mutex>`) around critical sections to prevent race conditions.

Connections to Other Modules:
- Used by SignatureAnalyzer and AnomalyAnalyzer to record alerts whenever a threat is detected.
- Used by IDS and Main program to display or clear alerts based on user interaction.
