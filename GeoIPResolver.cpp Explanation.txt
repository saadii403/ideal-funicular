GeoIPResolver.cpp Explanation
-------------------------------

Purpose:
- Implements the GeoIPResolver class methods declared in GeoIPResolver.h to map IP prefixes to country names.

Functions Implemented:
- GeoIPResolver::GeoIPResolver():
  - Constructor that calls loadStaticData() to initialize the IP-to-country mappings when an object is created.

- void GeoIPResolver::loadStaticData():
  - Populates the internal unordered_map with a few static IP prefixes mapped to country names (e.g., "203.0" => "China").

- std::string GeoIPResolver::getCountry(const std::string& ip) const:
  - Extracts the first two octets of the provided IP address (e.g., "203.0") and looks up the corresponding country in the ipToCountry map.
  - Returns "Unknown" if no match is found.

Object-Oriented Principles Used:
- **Encapsulation**:
  - The ipToCountry mapping is kept private.
  - Users interact only via the public getCountry() method.
- **Abstraction**:
  - Hides the complexity of IP parsing and matching from the user, providing a simple getCountry() interface.

Connections to Other Modules:
- SignatureAnalyzer.cpp and AnomalyAnalyzer.cpp both use GeoIPResolver to enhance alert messages with attacker location data.
- Alerts are more informative for users and for documentation/reporting purposes.
